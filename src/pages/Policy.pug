        One of the main considerations of our team was the public perception of GMOs. Our product is associated with a consumable: sugar. Although, our _E. coli_ are not directly 
        present in the end product, we have taken great care to design a [three-tier biosafety mechanism](/Safety) for the containment of our chassis.

        We wanted to begin by understanding the policies surrounding GMOs in various countries. Together with OhioState, iGEM Waterloo, UANL and DTU Denmark we gathered and compared 
        our respective countryâ€™s regulations on GMOs and biotechnology products in general. We focused on GMO regulation differences among countries, and loopholes in the current 
        regulations for different countries. Our purpose was to make the regulatory process more equal among countries and to make a way for iGEM teams to actually implement their 
        products in their respective countries by navigating the regulatory process.

        Following this, we wanted to take a closer look at how the public [perceives](/Education#Webinars) our product and GMOs. We released the same survey to the general public as well.
        Our primary question was to find out whether people would consume the sugar that is produced knowing that a genetically modified organism has been in the sugarcane, but not in the 
        final consumable product. We were happy to note a largely positive response for the same.
