        # A Note on Invertases

        Invertases (β-fructofuranosidases) are glycoprotein enzymes classified as Glycoside Hydrolases or GHs (under the GH-family) [BRENDA, n.d.](#citation1). Invertase catalyses the hydrolysis of 
        Sucrose into D-fructose and D-glucose through cleavage of the terminal non-reducing beta-fructofuranoside residues, a reaction known as inversion. In nature, 
        Invertase usually exists in various isoforms.

        Two of the main invertases found in sugarcane are the neutral invertases and acid invertases, which are spatially differentiated. Sucrose - the end product of photosynthesis, 
        is transported to three different cellular compartments: the cell wall (apoplastic space), the vacuole, and the cytoplasm. There is a specific invertase isoform for each compartment 
        [Shivalingamurthy, S. G., et al., 2018](#citation2):

        - Apoplastic space located cell wall invertase (CWI)/ Insoluble acid Invertase;
        - A Vacuolar located acid invertase (VAI) also termed a Soluble acid invertase (SAI); and
        - A cytoplasmic located Neutral invertase (NI)

        These isoforms of plant invertases are classified into 2 different GH families: GH32 and GH100. Cell wall invertases and Vacuolar invertases (Acid invertases) belong to the GH32 family, 
        while Cytoplasmic invertases (alkaline/neutral invertases) belong to the GH100 family. Acid invertase amino acid sequences generally do not share any similarity with sequences of GH100 
        enzymes, and the members of GH100 remain in need of structure elucidation and exact mechanism of action.

        In sugarcane, Invertase mainly regulates the plant metabolism and sucrose accumulation. It is crucial for metabolizing sucrose to provide energy to the cells for respiration, and to provide 
        a carbon source for glycosynthesis of various essential products. Sucrose accumulation begins in the elongating internodes, until maximum elongation is achieved. [Ansari, M. I. et al., 2013](#citation3). 
        In these immature intermodal tissues, it is found that the concentration of invertase is linearly related to the rate of intermodal elongation [Batta, S. K. & Singh, R., 1986](#citation4). Invertase action is triggered by changes in osmotic pressure of cells, thus 
        achieving cell elongation and growth.

        During pre- and post-harvest periods, however, Invertase has an undesirable role in continuously degrading sucrose (in the vacuoles and intracellular space) thereby reducing recovery rate and 
        overall sugar yield. Our genetically engineered _E. coli_ tries to to address this issue.

        # Radau Methods

        The system of ODEs we obtained for the kill switch were <dfn>stiff ~ A system of ODEs for which solvers are numerically unstable </dfn> in nature. 
        Explicit Runge-Kutta methods (like RK45) are unsuitable for solving such differential equations because of their small and bounded region of absolute stability.

        For an initial value problem 
        $$ \frac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y), \quad y(t_0) = y_0 $$

        An implicit Runge–Kutta method has the form

        $$ y_{n+1} = y_n + h\sum_{i=1}^{s}b_ik_i $$
        $$\text{where }k_i = f\\left(t_n + c_i h, y_n + h\sum_{j=1}^{s}a_{ij}k_j \\right) \quad i = 1, 2, \dots, s$$

        Owing to the stiffness of the equations, we had to solve our kill switch model using the fifth-order Radau IIA method, which is an implicit Runge-Kutta method where
        the coefficients \\(c_i\\) are given by the zeros of the polynomial \\( \frac{d^4}{dx^4}(x^4(x-1)^5) \\)
