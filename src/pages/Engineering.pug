      While designing SugarGain, we had to keep various considerations in mind. The initial idea was broken down into a set of problem statements and these formed the major pillars of our project. 
      The following diagrams illustrate the flow of our thought as we tried to solve these problems to the best of our ability. We also illustrate how we modelled our project and its interconnectedness 
      with the experiments we designed to complement the modelled data. Furthermore, we have taken into consideration the different outcomes that these experiments might lead to and planned accordingly. 
      Due to unavailability of lab access this year, we plan to finish these experiments in phase 2.
      
      For more details about these experiments, please see our [Experiments](/Experiments) page.

          h2 Problem Statement
          .rounded-rectangle
            p.
              Our project aims to reduce the activity of invertase, an enzyme that converts useful sucrose into profitless
              glucose and fructose. Since this process was important to the life cycle of the plant, it wasnâ€™t practical to 
              genetically re-engineer sugarcane cells itself. The most harm this enzyme causes is post-harvest and hence, that 
              seemed like the most logical time period for us to target.

            .number 
              p 1
            p.
              After surveying publications on invertases, we came across a group of proteins called anti-invertases/invertase 
              inhibitor which regulate invertase and control sugar hydrolysis.
          .rounded-rectangle
            .number 
              p 3
            p.
              We also discovered that anti-invertase has quite a small half-life. This meant that the invertase would have to 
              be secreted at the site of action (i.e., inside the sugarcane).
        .col-5
          .rounded-rectangle
            .number 
              p 2
            p.
              To decrease the nutrient load on our bacterial chassis and have a controlled release of our protein, we decided on a 
              biosensor mechanism.
          .rounded-rectangle
            .number 
              p 4
            p.
              Since the concentration of fructose was a more or less direct result of invertase activity, we wanted to calibrate a 
              self-regulatory mechanism that modulated the secretion of the anti-invertase in tandem with the concentration of 
              fructose in the medium. We were able to achieve that by using a pFruB-Cra system.

              Using these parts, we constructed our fructose regulated anti invertase.

            Due to the global pandemic, we were unable to complement our modelling with experimental results. However, we prepared

            p.
              Given the consumable nature of our product, we had to come up with a robust killswitch that was capable of 
              effectively terminating the bacteria taking into account the toxicity of killswitch with respect to the humans.

              First, we ascertained the trigger to be the swift and abrupt change in atmospheric conditions 
              (anaerobic inside the sugarcane stem and aerobic outside)

              Second, we found a toxin-antitoxin pair that was quite fatal to bacteria but did not affect human cells.

              Since our product includes live bacteria, we wanted to ensure that the product had a long shelf life. After consulting farmers in various belts

              This inoculant would be supplied to the farmer and can be used through an injector mechanism. In this manner 
              the sugarcane's inherent transport mechanism due to transpirational pull is leveraged for the uniform distribution of the 
              bacteria through the plant.
