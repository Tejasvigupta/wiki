        Our approach to human practices consisted of multiple frameworks which allowed us to effectively interview experts, users and regulatory agencies. During our ideation phase in January, 
        we identified the various diverse stakeholders relevant to our project.

        We pitched our idea to the professors of the Department of Biological Sciences of our university. The feedback that we received from this session was crucial for us to refine our initial approach. 

        We then approached our primary stakeholders — the farmers. In the schematic given below we can see the prominent sugarcane growing regions in India. In the course of the duration of our human practices, 
        we have contacted farmers from the states of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. We also visited the Sugar Mill Federation in Uttar Pradesh.

        > Schematic 

        # Belt One: Uttar Pradesh

        We met Mr. Sunil Kumar Ohri of the U.P. Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation Ltd. in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India, to get a better idea of the workings of the sugar industry. Mr. Ohri is the General Manager at the Federation 
        and a Council Member of the Sugar Technologists Association of India. He gave us valuable insights into the sugar production process, the losses incurred during it, and how post-harvest losses are a major issue for the sugar mill 
        and the farmers alike. He graciously supplied us with real time field data of the CCS loss of sucrose in sugarcane for the state of Uttar Pradesh and was instrumental in validating our idea, giving us theoretical backing across a 
        variety of sugarcane crops. 

        In the Uttar Pradesh belt, mills are situated close to the farm (within a 25-50 kilometer radius) in accordance with state government regulations. Currently, Uttar Pradesh and most states in India face huge problems of land shortage 
        and area saturation. In India, sugarcane farms are usually located not very close to the mills, so by the time the harvested cane reaches the factory, a lot of the sugar content has already been lost. Sugarcane constitutes 90% of the 
        manufacturing cost of sugar and the viability of sugar factories solely depends on the availability of sugarcane from cane growing areas for crushing in the factory.

        It typically takes around 100-110 hours (around 4.5 days) for the harvesting, the post-harvesting processing and the transport of sugarcane from the farm to the mill. In Uttar Pradesh, cane is typically milled on the fourth or fifth day 
        from harvest. This duration is enough for sugar recovery to fall by upto 35%, as shown in the figure below. A loss of 0.4% in sugar recovery translates to a financial loss of ₹6,00,00,000 [very huge number, citation pls]. Post-harvest 
        losses bring down sugar recovery from 2.6% to 1.9%, leading to financial losses of up to 39 crores annually — just in the state of Uttar Pradesh.

        He also mentioned that although there has been significant research in this area, as of yet there is no commercially viable solution.

        Our interaction with Mr Ohri laid the foundation for SugarGain. The real time data that he gave us formed the basis of our mathematical models and simulations. 

        # Belt Two: Mandya and Gulbarga

        We next the opportunity of speaking to small-scale sugarcane farmers from the Mandya and Gulbarga region in the state of Karnataka.

        The farmer from Mandya told us that in some cane-growing areas, harvesting has been delayed by up to 14 months, reducing the yield by 20-30 per cent. The farmer has to travel all the way to the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu to sell the sugarcane 
        thereby exacerbating the problem of post harvest losses. The farmer from Gulbarga had a different set of issues. On his fifteen-acre farm, it has been difficult to cultivate sugarcane, due to lack of steady water and power supply. The farmer has been 
        had been trying to construct borewells that went almost 200ft deep, but with no luck. Labour is expensive, and the farm is plowed manually by bullock. The farms on the other side of the Bhima river however, grow sugarcane extensively since irrigation 
        is easy. He also told us that mills have been non-operational in the area ever since the lockdown that was imposed in lieu of the pandemic. This has led to improper storage of the harvested cane. 

        -----
        With the preliminary interactions which we had with Mr Ohri and the farmers from Mandya and Gulbarga we learnt the following : 
        1. Each belt has a unique problem when it comes to post harvest losses and our solution would have to be comprehensive. 
        2. There are innate inefficiencies in the system that can be tackled by our solution. Such as, in Uttar Pradesh the inefficiency of mills contributes most to post harvest losses. Similarly in Mandya and Gulbarga the improper storage and economic crisis 
        impacts sugar retrieval rates.

        Our next step was to find out more about post-harvest losses globally. We were fortunate to meet our alumni during the BITSAA Global Meetup (BGM). BGM which was held from 17th to the 19th of January 2020 was attended by over 1100 participants which included alumni of 
        the four different campuses of BITS Pilani namely, Pilani, Goa, Dubai and Hyderabad. This BGM followed in the footsteps of the three previous successful BGMs which were held in Delhi, Hyderabad and Dubai starting from 2011 at an interval of three years. During the BGM 
        we had the opportunity to pitch our project to a diverse group of distinguished alumni. It was through this interaction that we truly understood the global scope of post harvest losses. 

        We learnt that it is due to a combination of factors unique to each country that contribute to post-harvest losses. Most sugar industries in the world are impacted severely by the problem of post-harvest losses. In South Africa in 2009, 70.0% of the cane supply was harvested 
        from mill controlled fields, with 55.5% being mill owned [Neves et al., 2010], giving mill operators significant control over the supply process for the mill. In this situation, the mill does not face the problem of being oversupplied during the peak season as in Thailand nor 
        is the issue of integrating the decision-making process between growers and harvesters of importance as seen in South Africa. Furthermore, we learnt that harvesting in Brazil is done 24 hours a day, and as a result, storage is not an issue as it is Australia, Cuba, and the 
        United States. 

        Following this, we went through several design iterations of our product. Once we created our chassis we were interested in finding out the economic viability, scaling up and commercialisation.

        # Rohan, Bejoy, Andre et al.

        We met up with Rohan Ranganath, a 2020 BITS Pilani Chemical Engineering graduate, to decide how to go about scaling up our project to a pilot or a small scale industrial plant. We went through various iterations of process design which you can find on our [implementation page](/Implementation). 
        We also drew up a rough process flow diagram which we showed to an industry professional.

        As a follow up to our global scope study, we put up a few messages on Slack asking for information with sugarcane in different countries. André Hermann, the member of iGEM Policy committee, graciously volunteered. We had a brief interaction with him about the nature of the industry in Brazil. We also 
        learnt how to go about formulating [policy](/Policy) that would regulate the application of our product. 

        Our next steps involved fine tuning our delivery mechanism. We devised a polymer inoculant applied through an injector mechanism. It was crucial for us to understand how viable this would be in real-time. We had the opportunity to interact with farmers from the Tamil Nadu belt and pitch our mechanism to them.

        # Belt 3: Tamil Nadu

        We learnt that farmers of the Tamil Nadu belt are paid by weight of sugarcane where the loss of even water leads to loss of prices. Distances to mill are usually less than 12 kilometers and losses are are amplified by 5-10% as the distance increases. The state government also provides extensive subsidies to sugarcane farmers in the state. 
        It was crucial that the delivery mechanism has to be something easy to use and the inoculant needs to have a large shelf life so that the farmer can choose when to use the product and it has to be completely organic. This validated our approach to having a scaled up system producing a polymer inoculant that facilitates easy 
        transport and usage of our chassis.

        To find out if our product is truly viable in the market we conducted an [economic viability analysis](/Entrepreneurship). Dr Bejoy Thomas from IISER Pune was instrumental in guiding us with this model. He specialises in Sustainable Development Goals 1, 2, 6 and 13 and tacking Multidimensional poverty. We were fortunate to be able to show him our model and get his opinion on the impact of our product for Sustainable Development Goals namely SDG 2: Zero Hunger. 

        The final stakeholder that we met was the Chief Chemist of Kichha Sugar Company Ltd. — one of the leading sugar producers in the Uttar Pradesh belt. We gained knowledge on the mill and farmer relationships and more importantly the impact of the pandemic on the sugar industry. (You can find out detailed questionnaire here)
