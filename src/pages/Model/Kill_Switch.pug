        The first step involved in modelling the kill switch was to carry out a literature survey to understand the functioning of the module at a moelcular level and understand the various mechanisms 
        and reactions involved.

        The kill switch has been designed to be activated by exposure to atmospheric concentrations of oxygen. Oxygen binds to the FNR promoter, thereby suppressing the transcription of the antitoxin 
        and the absence of which leads to an accumulation of toxin in the cell, leading to cell death. Our model was based on the mechanism proposed by Gelens et al. [2013](#citation9) with certain modifications
        that are specific to our construct. Our model involves an **inducible transcription** of the toxin, and whose kinetics are governed by appropriate Hill equations. 
        The diagram below provides a detailed account of the processes and the reaction pathways involved. 

        > Image describing the construct with all its products. 

        Six different chemical species have to be accounted for: the toxin mRNA (\\( M_T \\)), the antitoxin mRNA (\\( M_A \\)), the toxin (\\( T \\)), the antitoxin (\\( A \\)), a complex of the form \\( TA \\) (\\( C_1 \\)), 
        and another complex of the form \\( TAT \\) (\\( C_2 \\)); the concentrations of these species are determined by forming ordinary differential equations. 

        We make the following assumptions in our model:

        1. Our inducible and repressible mechanisms follow Hill characteristics.

        2. (**Quasi-steady state approximation**) Due to a difference in the time scales involved between binding/unbinding of FNR and oxygen (happening in the order of milliseconds) and transcription/translation (happening in the order of minutes), we assume that the 
        concentration of the oxidised FNR promoter, \\( [FNR-O_2] \\) remains time-invariant, that is, \\( \frac{d[FNR-O_2]}{dt} = 0 \\).

        3. The transcription rates for both the toxin and antitoxin mRNAs were assumed to be approximately similar.

        4. The initial concentrations of all chemical species was assumed to be zero.

        # Differential Equations

        We write the coupled <dfn> ODEs ~ Ordinary Differential Equations </dfn> that describe the reactions illustrated above as follows.

        $$
        \begin{aligned}
            \frac{d[M_A]}{dt} &= \rho_A\frac{C_N}{1 + k_D[O_2]}  - \delta_A[M_A] \\\\
            \frac{d[M_T]}{dt} &= \rho_TC_N - \delta_T[M_T] \\\\
            \frac{d[A]}{dt} &= \beta_A[M_A] + \theta_c[C_1] - d_A[A] - \alpha_c[T][A] \\\\
            \frac{d[T]}{dt} &= \beta_T[M_T] + \theta_c[C_1] + Fd_A[C_1] + 2Fd_A[C_2] - d_T[T] - \alpha_c[T][A] - \alpha_c[C_1][A] \\\\
            \frac{d[C_1]}{dt} &= \alpha_c[A][T] + \theta_c[C_2] - \theta_c[C_1] - d_T[C_1] - Fd_A[C_1] - \alpha_c[C_1][T] \\\\
            \frac{d[C_2]}{dt} &= \alpha_c[C_1][T]  - \theta_c[C_2] - d_T[C_2] - Fd_A[C_2]\\\\
        \end{aligned}
        $$

        The parameters used in the above set of equations along with their description and numerical values are tabulated below. In the absence of literature on the \\( FNR/O_2 \\) interactions, we have 
        made educated guessed about some parameter values.

        # Simulations of the model

        As we had no lab access, we could not verify the values of parameters through experimental analysis; however, we have designed experiments that we would have conducted to verify the parameter values through curve fitting. 
        These experiments can be found on our [experiments](/Experiments) page. The next step would be to solve the above ODEs numerically to obtain the concentrations of free toxin and antitoxin. 
        
        To activate the kill switch, we require a "trigger", or a change in the surrounding oxygen concentration. This trigger was achieved by modelling the oxygen concentration as a step function, \\( O(t) \\), that represents 
        the concentration of oxygen in the environment of the cell. This function can be expressed as

        $$
            O(t) = O_1H(300 - t) + O_2H(t - 300)
        $$

        where \\( O_1 \text{ and } O_2\\) are the oxygen concentrations inside and outside the sugarcane matrix, respectively and \\( H(x) \\) is the Heaviside step function.

        This function was constructed such that the kill switch would be activated at the \\(t = 300 \text{ min}\\) mark. This time instance was selected to allow us to observe the steady state concentrations of both, the toxin and antitoxin. The jump 
        in the concentration, given by the point of discontinuity in the step function, corresponds to the exposure of the cell to an aerobic environment, with atmospheric levels of oxygen.

        The ODEs were solved numerically using SciPy's `solve_ivp` method using the [Radau](Appendix) algorithm and the concentrations of free ccdA and ccdB were plotted against time.

        From the graph, it is seen that around the \\(t = 300 \text{ min}\\) mark (when the kill switch is activated), the concentration of free ccdA begins to drop, reaches a minimum and that of free ccdB beings to rise. 
        After a while, the only major chemical species in the cellular system are the toxin, ccdB and highly stable complexes. Therefore, the toxin accumulates in the cell and reaches a high enough concentration to kill it.
