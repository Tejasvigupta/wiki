        A biosensor system is often used in biological systems to detect an analyte of interest. Our intention behind utilising a biosensor system in our project was to have a controlled release of the protein of interest, that is the invertase inhibitor. 
        Since fructose is a product of hydrolysis of sucrose, its concentration directly proportional to the activity of invertase. Our construct therefore produces an anti-invertase enzyme whose quantity is regulated by the concentration of fructose in the 
        cellular environment.

        We used the FruR-Cra system to modulate the output protein. The expression of the FruR gene is regulated by an IPTG-induced pTac promoter, which is induced before packaging the bacteria in our polymer inoculant. FruR is a transcription factor with an 
        affinity for fructose-1-phosphate (F1P) â€” an important component of most metabolic pathways. It is formed from D-fructose, which itself is produced by the hydrolysis of sucrose. The FruR protein prevents transcription of the regulated promoters. pFruB 
        is the promoter region following FruR and is repressed by the FruR transcription factor. In the absence of D-Fructose, the FruR gene transcribes a protein that represses the activity of pfruB, hence controlling the output of the invertase inhibitor.  
        You can find more about our construct on the [design](/Design#Fructose-regulatedConstruct) page.

        We planned on simiulating the dynamics of the pFruB-Cra system _in silico_ but the lack of lab access due to COVID lockdowns coupled with an unavailability of any literature on the kinetic studies of the FruR system limited us to a theoretical model. We have however 
        planned a few experiments that we would have conducted to determine the kinetics of the model. You can find them on our experiments page [here](/Experiments).

        The assumptions we have made for the model are listed below:

        1. As cells would be IPTG-induced before being added to the inoculant, we have assumed that the total number of FruR molecules remains constant during the course of the action of the cells.

        2. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of fructose is not considered to simplify the model. We assume that all the fructose that is taken up by the cell is immediately phosphorylated. Hence, 
        the amount of fructose is roughly equal to the amount of fructose-1-phosphate. Subsequently, the metabolic pathway from F1P leading to FBP, F6P, G6P is also ignored.

        3. The FruR-F1P complex is higly stable and the degradation rate is almost zero. This ensures that the FruR in the complex is not recycled back such that it can preferentially bind to pFruB. 
        
        4. The binding rate for F1P and FruR is unaffected by pfruB.

        5. FruR only binds to pfruB when it is bound to the DNA sequence.

        6. F1P binds to FruR and helps it unbind from pFruB. 

        7. There is a constant external source of FruR and pFruB which maintains their concentrations at a steady, constant level throughout the timescale of the model.

        # Differential Equations

        The set of <dfn> ODEs ~ Ordinary Differential Equations </dfn> that model the FruR-Cra kinetics are illustrated below:

        $$
        \begin{aligned}
            \frac{d[A]}{dt} &= \frac{e_A [P]}{\left( 1 + \frac{[R]}{k_R} \right) \left( 1 + \frac{[F]}{k_F} \right)} - \beta_A[A]\\\\
            \frac{d[M]}{dt} &= \frac{e_M [P]}{\left( 1 + \frac{[R]}{k_R} \right) \left( 1 + \frac{[F]}{k_F} \right)} - \beta_M[M]\\\\
            \frac{d[F]}{dt} &= k_2 [C_1] - k_1[F][C_2]\\\\
            \frac{d[R]}{dt} &= k_2 [C_1] - k_3[R][P]\\\\
            \frac{d[C_1]}{dt} &= -k_1[F][C_2] + k_3[R][P]\\\\
            \frac{d[C_2]}{dt} &= k_1[C_2]F - k_2[C_1]\\\\
        \end{aligned}
        $$
