        # Overview

        Mathematical models are an integral part of our project. They allow us to gain an insight into the functioning of the
        constructs we designed as well as enable us to predict and verify its behaviour. As we couldn't experimentally verify 
        our claims due the COVID-19 imposed lockdown, these models form the cornerstone of our project.  

        We have formed a total of six models that cover various aspects of SugarGain. To provide a brief overview, they are:
         
        1. An model to describe our FruR-Cra construct. 
        2. An _in silico_ simulation of the kill switch.
        3. A model to determine the composition and optimum viscosity of our novel polymer inoculant.
        4. A model to predict the growth of bacteria in the sugarcane matrix.
        5. An _in silico_ model to study the interactions between invertase and anti-invertase, as well as FruR and fructose.
        6. A model to explain the relavnce of auxotrophy in our chassis.
