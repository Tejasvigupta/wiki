       Mathematical models are an integral part of our project. They allow us to gain an insight into the functioning of the constructs we designed 
       as well as enable us to predict and verify its behaviour. Considering our non-existent access to a laboratory environment due to COVID-19, 
       these models form the cornerstone of our project. 

        To ensure that the models we generate are robust and not quixotic, we have tried to integrate them, during each step of the modelling process, 
        with the experiments we have designed. The benefits that this approach has are two-fold: one, it allowed the experimental and theoretical 
        portions of the project to complement each other, and two, it also allowed us to leverage the insights provided by the wetlab aspects. 

        Each model was designed to integrate and influence the final project. By maintaining this synergised approach, we also ensured that the modelling 
        and the experiments team developed conviction in their ideas.
