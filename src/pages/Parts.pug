    We have contributed 5 new parts to the registry. They include three basic parts and 2 composite parts. These parts have
    been designed and optimised for production and secretion of our gene if interest. We have added literature and constants
    (wherever applicable) for each of these parts along with the relevant mathematical models that describe their working.
