                            Sugarcane is one of India’s most important crops. It is cultivated on 5 million hectares of land, 
                            making India the second-largest producer of the crop which contributes to 6% of the national GDP 
                            and forms the livelihood for 20 million people across the country.

                            This industry is in peril, however. Post-harvest sucrose deterioration is responsible for losses worth millions of rupees.
                            Following its harvest, enzymatic activity reduces sugar recovery rates by upto 10%!

                            We aim to target invertase present in the sugarcane stem - the enzyme responsible for 
                            cleaving sucrose into its constituents. Our project is structured into three major 
                            modules: a fructose regulated anti-invertase construct, an atmospherically-regulated kill switch, 
                            and a novel polymer inoculant.

                            Throughout our project design we have tried to be cognizant about identifying strategies for robust 
                            biosafety. To ensure the highest possible levels of safety, we have developed a three-tier failsafe meachanism after 
                            taking into consideration the various use cases of our chassis.

                            Human Practices is essential for responsible project design. Our approach to human practices consisted of multiple iterations 
                            which allowed us to effectively interview industry experts, researchers and users. Throughout our project, we identified and 
                            spoke to various diverse stakeholders relevant to our project.

                            As a team participating in iGEM for the first time, we were absolutely thrilled by the community spirit that iGEM fosters. 
                            It was amazing to see how helpful everyone was, and over the years, participating teams had developed into a tightly-knit 
                            community, working together on shared goals and aspirations, and having lots of fun along the way!
                        p.
                            To contribute to this amazing community, we developed three softwares: iGEM WikiSync: A continuous deployment tool for iGEM wikis;
                            iGEM WikiSync Github Action: A Github Actions plugin that allows Github repositories to deploy wikis to iGEM servers; and the iGEM Wiki 
                            Starter Pack: The easiest way to build iGEM Wikis.
