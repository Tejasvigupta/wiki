                            Sugarcane is one of India’s most important crops; a crop that has been grown since ancient times.
                            It is cultivated on 5 million hectares of land, making India the second-largest producer of the crop 
                            which contributes to 6% of the national GDP and forms the livelihood for 20 million people across the country.

                           This industry is in peril, however. Post-harvest sucrose deterioration is responsible for losses worth millions of rupees.
                           Following its harvest, invertase present in sugarcane irreversibly cleaves sucrose into its constituents, reducing sugar recovery rates by upto 10%.

                            but home page is probably not the right place for that. Safety section is at the bottom, but maybe
                            briefly mention the killswitch as well?
                        p.
                            Also talk about the delivery mechanism. Maybe this is the right place to mention why we went 
                            with a syn bio solution instead of just injecting the inhibitor.

                            Headline too cringey? Questionable color choice? Apparently orange is the color of 
                            communication. It's a really hard color to work with, though. Increasing saturation any
                            more hurts my eyes, reducing it saturation makes orange lose its effect and reducing 
                            brightness makes it dull. Btw, scroll up for an inverted Indian flag.

                            communication is necessary, specially keeping the current situation in mind.
                            Also write about Abhighyan insta posts? Is that sci-comn or public engagement? 
                            I'll just call the button Communication for now.
